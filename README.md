The first task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
I took titanic dataset as they mentioned we can consider any dataset in the instructions.
Downloaded the dataset from kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/
